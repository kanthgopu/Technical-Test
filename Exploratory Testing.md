Exploratory Testing: I felt below are some of the bugs I found in the application.1. Hotel name Field: It is accepting special characters and there is no maximum character length.2. Owner Field: It is accepting numbers and special characters.There is no maximum character length.3. Phone number Field: It is accepting characters, special characters and space.There is no maximum integer length.4. Email Field: There is no correct e-mail address syntax and no maximum length.5. After you created an new entry,the new entry fields should be blank but new entry fields are pre-filled with the previous entry fields.6. Entered E-mail address is overlapping with the cross mark.7. After you search for the hotel name in the search field and you want to log in into the application it should log in to the application.8. After you logged in the application and if you search for something in the application it should not be logged you out.9. After you logged in the application and if you search for something in the application it is logging you out and when you go back to the previous page it is showing that you logged in.
